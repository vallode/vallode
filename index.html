<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>My name is <strong>Mariusz</strong>, I am also known as <strong>Vallode</strong> on the internet</p>
<p>I am a full stack developer, currently working freelance here and there and trying to settle down in a full time position. I enjoy a variety of different hobbies, from DIY woodworking to gardening.</p>
<p>I work on many different projects at any given time, seeing as I do not have a full time job I try to fill my time with productivity.</p>
