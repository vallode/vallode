<h2>Find out about me</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is <b>Mariusz</b> also known as <b>Vallode</b> on the Internet</p>
<p>I currently live in London but that might change as I am not a sedentary person. I was born in Poland in 1998 and enjoyed playing with miniature soldiers and cars until the age of 7 when my family and I moved to England. I received my first computer promptly after that to help with studies and that set off a fire inside me. A fire that will never be put out and never satisfied. That fire was the passion for <b>computer programming</b></p>
<h2>My passion(s)</h2>
<p>I have a great deal of interest in many things but let me walk you through the most important things in my life:</p>
<p><b>Languages: </b> As my knowledge of programming languages, and their individual uses, grew I started to look over at communication in the real world. I grew up half and half in Poland and England which meant for me that I started off with a bonus: I know both <b>Polish and English</b> fluently. 
<p>Languages, as well as computer languages, have their uses and I believe that you ability to communicate and solve problems grows with the amount you know about other languages. Certain emotions can only be communicated efficiently through certain languages, the same way as certain problems can only be tackled well in certain programming languages.</p>
<p><b>Computer Science: </b> The beauty of computing and its studies is that it can be applied anywhere. 
<p>Its benefits can be experienced in every field, from physics to botany, computer science can be used to enhance our knowledge and solve problems that might seem too big for us but tiny for computers. I enjoy taking everyday issues and solving them using my computer to help me out. Having a second brain (that is also multitudes more powerful than you) is always useful, <b>for everyone.</b></p>
