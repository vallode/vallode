  I try to aim high for anything I do, and learn from the failures along the
  way. My many <b>hobbies</b> keep me busy: <span>playing the cello, cycling, writing sci-fi,
  photography,</span> and trying to be a <b>little more</b>, every day, takes up the 
  rest of my time.
</p>

<p>
  I enjoy working with <b>people different to me</b>, I have had the privilege
  of working with many exceptional characters over my <span>4 years</span> in
  the tech industry.
