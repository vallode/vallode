<h2>A little bit about myself</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is <strong>Mariusz</strong>, I am also known as <strong>Vallode</strong> on the internet</p>
<p>I am a front-end developer, with experience in full-stack development, who works mostly freelance. I want to settle down into a full-time job, somewhere outside of London hopefully I want to explore a bit more of the world!<br>
I partake in a lot of hobbyist activities, I enjoy learning languages (not only programming ones), gardening, reading books and painting</p>
<p>I have a great passion for computer programming and I want to continue exploring the many possibilities in the computing world</p>
