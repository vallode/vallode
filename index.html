<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>My name is <strong>Mariusz</strong>. I also go by my alias <strong>Vallode</strong></p>
<p>I am a freelance web developer, currently situated in <strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>. I have a passion for learning from others and exploring the world around me. My best buddies are a dog, her name is <strong>Arya</strong>, and a pet praying mantis whom I have yet to name. Gardening and reading books, specifically sci-fi, as well as collecting magnets from the different cities I visit are a tasteful selection of my hobbies.</p>
<p>I tend to work on various ideas that pique my interest and this site is a medium of sharing these projects with the world. I am currently working on a <a href='http://miki.ai/'>website</a> for a discord bot, as well as with my clients for various freelance projects.</p>
