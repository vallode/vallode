<h2>A little bit about myself</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is <b>Mariusz</b>, I am also known as <b>Vallode</b> on the internet</p>
<p>I am a front-end developer who works mostly freelance, I do want to settle down into a full-time job though! Hopefully somewhere in the Netherlands, as I love the country and am learning dutch!<br>
I partake in a lot of hobbyist activities, I enjoy painting and reading. I have many plants that I enjoy taking care of and I like collecting magnets from different places in the world I visit</p>
<p>I have a great passion for all things tech, mainly for programming and computer science and I hope to work my way towards being a full-stack developer. After that, who knows!</p>
