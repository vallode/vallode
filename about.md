### About

I believe about creating everything in an open environment, this website does
not fall out of those ideals. Hence why you can find it's entire source on
[gitlab](https://gitlab.com/vallode/blog).

The tech stack is simple:

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (static site builder)
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) (CSS extension language)
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (static site hosting)

If you have any questions about this site, feel free to reach out to me.
