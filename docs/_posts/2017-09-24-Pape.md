A full-stack project to create an efficient wallpaper sharing service

**Project**: Pape Wallpaper sharing

**User story**: I am able to browse through and download a curated list of wallpapers

This will be an ongoing edited blog post on the creation of this project. I will try to record most of the thought process here

As part of my learning process I have created [smol.link](http://www.smol.link/) in order to learn about databases and further back-end development. It has been fun and there is a separate write up for that project [here](LINKHERE)
