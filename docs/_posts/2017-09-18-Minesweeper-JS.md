A project to hone my JavaScript skills and remake a game that I love dearly

**Project**: Minesweeper JS

**User story**: I can play the original Minesweeper in my browser

I wanted to use my JavaScript knowledge to build something that I would use, I found other minesweeper clones to bit a tad bit clunky with an outdated interface behind them so I decided to make my own.

The code is fairly simply, so it is easy to read through.

The next steps I want to take is incorporate a leaderboard as well as an options menu for some more authenticity.
