Show a basic understanding of CSS and HTML and create a tribute page for an outstanding member of the scientific community

**Project**: Vera Rubin tribute page

**User story**: I can view a tribute page to Vera Rubin and navigate to an external website for further information

Vera Rubin is a great inspiriation to me, so when I saw one of the challenges on freecodecamp was to create a tribute page for a person I knew exactly who I would chose.

There is very little to say about this website, I used flex-box liberally to ensure a smooth responsive design and a few media queries to fix certain issues on mobile resolutions.

The main bulk of time was spent trying to ensure the layout makes sense and flows well on every resolution and I think I have achieved that. The website took about an hour in total to make.
