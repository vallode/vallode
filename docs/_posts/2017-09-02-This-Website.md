A rundown of my experience designing and creating my personal website.

**Project**: Personal website

**User story**: I am able to read about Mariusz and his endevours

This website is made to house the rest of my projects and also serve as a blogging platform. I managed to achieve it with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and pure CSS. I wanted to use a style that is befitting for all platforms, which lead me to use a minimalistic column with a simple nav bar that has plenty of room for expansion.

A few issues I ran into was trying to keep a minimalistic design but also ensure I display my best abilities in this website as it will be the first thing people see of my design. The website is responsive and sleek, I think that demonstrates my ability to balance form and function.

I had a few friends take a look to provide feedback and tweaked the site accordingly, apart from that the entire thing took around 6 hours. Mostly learning how to use and encorporate Jekyll into the design.

Next up: More projects!
