<p>Hi, I am <strong>Mariusz</strong>. I also go by my alias <strong>Vallode</strong></p>
<p>
    I am a freelance web developer currently living in <strong>London, United Kingdom.</strong>
    I work with clients to bring their dreams to the front page and spread word about their product.
</p>
<p>
    I enjoy caring for plants, reading books, exercising, and solving problems.
    I strive for the very best, not only for myself but for the people that come after.
</p>
<p>
    I work on projects that pique my interest and share them with the world in hopes someone else likes them.
    I am currently working on a website for a discord bot and some other minor projects that I will post here.
</p>
