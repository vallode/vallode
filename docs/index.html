<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<br>
<p>
    My name is <strong>Mariusz</strong>. I also go by my alias <strong>Vallode</strong>
</p>
<p>
    I am a freelance web developer currently living in <strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>.
    Taking care of plants, reading and exercising are a selective
    few of my interests. Learning from others, exploring the world and somehow helping out
    are my long-term goals and dreams. I want to solve problems
    and make life that little bit easier for people.
</p>
<p>
    I tend to work on various ideas that pique my interest
    and this site is a medium of sharing these projects with
    the world. I am currently working on a <a href='http://miki.ai/'>website</a>
    for a discord bot, as well as with my clients for various freelance projects.
