<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<br>
<p>
    My name is <strong>Mariusz</strong>. I also go by my alias <strong>Vallode</strong>
</p>
<p>
    I am a freelance web developer currently living in <strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>.
    I work with amazing clients to bring their websites to the forefront of the internet and spread
    word about their quality products or services.
</p>
<p>
    I love caring for plants and generally nature itself, one day I hope that
    we can live in a world where I won't have to worry about the future
    generations' problems but look forward to their innovations.
    I tend to work on various ideas that pique my interest
    and this site is a medium of sharing these projects with
    the world. I am currently working on a <a href='http://miki.ai/'>website</a>
    for a discord bot and some other minor projects that will be posted here.
