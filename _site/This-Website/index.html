I managed to achieve it with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and pure CSS. I wanted to use a style that is befitting for all platforms, which lead me to use a minimalistic column with a simple nav bar that has plenty of room for expansion.</p> <p>A few issues I ran into was trying to keep a minimalistic design but also ensure I display my best abilities in this website as it will be the first thing people see of my design. The website is responsive and sleek, I think that demonstrates my ability to balance form and function.</p> <p>I had a few friends take a look to provide feedback and tweaked the site accordingly, apart from that the entire thing took around 6 hours. Mostly learning how to use and encorporate Jekyll into the design.</p> <p>Next up: More projects!</p> </div> </div> <footer> <span>Made with <img src='/images/heart.svg'> by <a href='https://vallode.cf/'>Me</a></span> </footer> </div> </body> <script>!function(e,t,a,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=t.createElement(a),s=t.getElementsByTagName(a)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-106151067-1","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script> </html>
