				<p>Tiny URL shortener to learn more about databases and back-end development</p>

<p><strong>Project</strong>: <a href="http://www.smol.link/">smol.link URL shortener</a></p>

<p><strong>User story</strong>: I am able to input a link and be provided a compact link that will redirect me to the original one</p>

<p>This has been a great project, I enjoy back-end development a lot because it is much more technical.</p>

<p>Let’s start the analysis then:
The first order of business was starting a good environment to develop in. Virtualenv for python was great with this, it creates a ‘dummy’ directory that acts like a standalone installation of python to help you keep dependencies clean and ordered.</p>

<p>Flask was a breeze, so easy to work with and their documentation was fantastic. I wrote up a dummy app first, their Flaskr tutorial was awesome and quickly adapted it to suit my needs.</p>

<p>So far so good, everything works and first test is successful. Obviously it took more than this but it was fairly basic development up to this point. Create a database, connect my python program to it and reroute URLs with a POST and GET method to encode a URL into the database and spit out a reference URL. Easy right?</p>

<p>A few problems:
What happens when people use an abnormal URL? Well the reroute would not work and the website would give a 404 error. Simple temporary fix was to to see if the link provided had either <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://</code> as part of its string.</p>

<p>Thankfully flask takes care of SOME attacks through user input but just to be sure there can be nothing done to my database I base64 encode all input and then decode it when returning a URL.</p>

<p>Further issues: I need to make sure that the system cannot be bloated, I will most likely keep a rudimentary cookie when a user receives a URL and limit a user to maybe 5 links a minute, something to think about.</p>

<p>I also want to prevent repetition in the database by locating duplicates, simple but might be performance hogging at some point in database size. Another thing to think about.</p>

<p>This has given me a lot to think about and taught me even more, I want to start development on the wallpaper sharing website now!</p>
