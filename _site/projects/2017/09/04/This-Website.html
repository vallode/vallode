            <p>A rundown of my experience designing and creating my personal website.</p>

<p><strong>Project</strong>: Personal website</p>

<p><strong>User story</strong>: I am able to read about Mariusz and his endevours</p>

<p>This website is made to house the rest of my projects and also serve as a blogging platform. I managed to achieve it with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and pure CSS. I wanted to use a style that is befitting for all platforms, which lead me to use a minimalistic column with a simple nav bar that has plenty of room for expansion.</p>

<p>A few issues I ran into was trying to keep a minimalistic design but also ensure I display my best abilities in this website as it will be the first thing people see of my design. The website is responsive and sleek, I think that demonstrates my ability to balance form and function.</p>

<p>I had a few friends take a look to provide feedback and tweaked the site accordingly, apart from that the entire thing took around 6 hours. Mostly learning how to use and encorporate Jekyll into the design.</p>

<p>Next up: More projects!</p>
