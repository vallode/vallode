A redesign and overhaul of this website

**Project**: Personal website v2.0

**User story**: I am able to read about Mariusz with a more stylish look to his website

I was a little bit disappointed with the first rendition of my website, I felt like it did not represent me as a character and as a developer. This overhaul aims to change that, I went with a very clear blue highlight as a theme and made sure that the website is clear and legible on all devices.

I cleaned up the code A LOT, around 70 lines of CSS went _poof_.

Overall, I am ecstatic with how this design came out. I hope you are too!
