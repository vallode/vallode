The website's tech stack is as simple as the site itself, aiming for good developer experience, respect to the user, and leanness:

* **Zola** - For static site generation
  * Incredibly fast, single dependency binary for generating static sites. 
  You couldn't ask for better, very happy with Zola coming previously from Jekyll.
* **SCSS** - For styling (built-in to Zola)
  * My favourite pre-processor for CSS, being built-in to Zola is an added
  bonus.
* **Netlify** - For deployment
  * Ease of use you cannot beat, I'll eventually get around to hosting this site
  on my own server but for now Netlify takes the cake.
* **Sourcehut** - For git hosting
  * No mess included git hosting, coming from gitlab it's a breath of fresh air.
