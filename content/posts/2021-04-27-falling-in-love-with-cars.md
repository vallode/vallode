I never really was a "car person", I understood the aesthetic pleasnatries
around cars but never really connected with them. This all changed when I
started to discover videos online talking about the topic of "van-life"
around two years ago. I was very quickly engrossed in the world of
refurbishing vans into small mobile homes and was keenly researching
the first vehicle I'd like to own.

While taking driving lessons I stumbled upon a really good deal for a
2003 Subaru Forester, it's my first car and I love it.

I want to walk through why I changed my mind on cars and why I think a
sense of ownership is so important in life (to me).

## Why a car?

Before I get started, I want to stress that most of what I will say
doesn't apply exlusively to cars. That is the whole point of this, my
frustration is I cannot apply what I am about to say to every object I
own but I digress.

## Ownership

I have been diving deep into understanding some fundemental things about my car:

* How does it work?
* How can I keep it working well?
* What can I do to make it work _better_?

The beautiful part of these three questions is that _answers to all
three are readibly available_ online and in the _manual that comes with
the car_.

Think about it, you bought a car and within a day or two of reading
you can more or less understand, in principle, the way the entire thing
works and how you can keep it running smoothly yourself.

It's an interesting experience in a world of locked down hardware,
subscription based software, and intanginble goods.

In a world where true ownership of the things you use every day is rare,
a nearly 20 year old car is a blessing.

## Community

The "car community" (there is one for most every make/model of car out
there) is simply put incredible. So many people are willing to spend
their free time helping you fix or troubleshoot your car.

While hostility exists, as it does in almost every community out there,
it is a very small portion of my experience with it and the vast majority
of people are incredibly helpful and insightful.

It's interesting to see the same values that power the "small web"
are deeply ingrained in the veins of any car enthusiast.

## Conclusions

This is more of a draft post, I wanted to throw my thoughts out there
because I want to see if my opinion changes in the future.
