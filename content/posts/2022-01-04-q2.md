> Do you believe in ghosts or evil spirits?  Would you be willing to spend a night alone in a remote house that is supposedly haunted?

Two questions for the price of one!

I believe in forces that are outside of our understanding, forces that might we
might never understand. A counter question: if you knew of the existance of 
atoms but did not have the modern equipment to prove they exists, are they just
ghosts?

Cold spots, things moving on their own, ominous noises and emotions, and all
manner of spooky happenings can all be the result of forces that we either
do not understand or simply could not measure yet.

Therefore the answer is no, I don't believe in evil spirits or ghosts. However,
I believe that there are things beyond our understanding that can be interpreted
as being spirits.

I guess this is where I have to put my money where my mouth is, would I spend
a night in a haunted house? Yeah probably, depending on context.
