Preface most of what I say here with "I think", it's all within the bounds of my personal opinion.

Websites are a form of human art, from the [tiny plain-text blogs](https://web.archive.org/web/20210219212122/https://blog.notryan.com/009.txt) to the massive sprawling [hubs of information](https://web.archive.org/web/20220105200255/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Size_of_Wikipedia) on Wikipedia, we express ourselves through this digital art form.

Let's brush the typical "is brushing your teeth art?" argument aside, since that is a topic for another day. I want to talk about how I approach creating websites (like this one) and why I dislike "minimalism" in web design. 

> **Miniamlism** - a style of art, music or design that uses very simple ideas or a very small number of simple elements

1. A good UX is not always achieved by minimal websites
2. Raw creativity is often squandered in favor of efficiency

There seems to be a common trend, especially in the tech community, that in order to be efficient
you have to adopt the mindset of a minimalist.

My opinions are based on mostly anecdotal evidence, I am going off of what I saw and heard through
my years on the internet and as a developer. Take them with more than a pinch of salt.

I dislike minimalism for the sake of minimalism, Modern
web design is flawed in many ways, but there are also many things we can learn from it. A good
few "small web" enthusiasts seem to take the road that everything we have done since the dawn of the
2000s is to be ignored.

This website itself is an ongoing experiment where I try to find a key balance between **user
experience, programming efficiency, and _art_**.

As of writing this article the landing page of the website is _around_ 2KB, it _used_ to be below
that and I want to try and keep it within the 5KB range in the near future. I'm quite proud of this,
while the website currently can be seen as quite minimal, I hope to add more and more flare to it
as I go. Taking care that it _adds_ to the experience, rather than deteriorates it.
