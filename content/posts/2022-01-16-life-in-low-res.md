Most desktop PCs are hooked up to monitors that are at least 1080p
in resolution, most phones have at least 720p screens, some flamoyant
individuals even go as high as 4k!

This is all wrong. As with black friday, pixel consumerism has gone too far and
I want to prove to myself that you can live without it.
