> For a person you loved deeply, would you be willing to move to a distant country knowing there
would be little chance of seeing your friends or family again?

My gut answer: Yes.

The first instinct I have upon digesting the question is that the implication of there being
"little chance" of seeing my friends and family again means that I cannot rely on the idea
that modern transporation methods exist (i.e seeing them is not as simple as jumping on a plane or
in a car).

That being said, I think I'm enough of a hopeless romantic to subscribe to the idea that, given the
chance, I'd be very happy to throw away whatever life I currently have in order to seek the
thrilling adventure of exploring another.

Life is too short to miserate over potential lost of contacts. Do not get me wrong, I love my
friends and family but the world has much to offer and I do not feel remorse in
saying I'd abandon it all for the excitement of new cultures and beginnings.
