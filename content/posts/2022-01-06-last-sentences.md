I read the last sentences of the books I read before starting them in earnest.

Sometimes I'll read the first bit of the first chapter before jumping right
to the end of the book and reading the very last sentence. I might read the last
two to get some context, but never more than 2 or 3 lines down.

Why do I do this? I find that many books have incredibly interesting last lines
that give me motiviation to read through the whole story. Often I'll read them
and think to myself "How in the world does it get to this?!".
