I'm a **web developer**, a bit of a handyperson. I am focused on UX right now, trying to supplement
my knowledge of frontend and backend programming with the empathy designers have for users.

I'm a **big fan** of the small (not _necessarily_ minimal) web, feel free to explore this plot of
digital land that I call my homepage.

Here is some tech I am excited about:

- Elixir
- _Ruby on_ Rails
- Zola

As most people my presence on the internet is vast (annoyingly so), you can find me active on a few
different websites:
