Web developer. Currently focused on learning more about User Experience. I like reading sci-fi, sharing, and building things that last.

Thanks for dropping by, hope you find what you came for.

Working at [lobelia.earth](//lobelia.earth) helping convey climate data and
create tools that help address the climate emergency.

I also help out at [and-less](//and-less.at/) build new sustainable packaging for the gastronomy sector.

I try to take care of these:

- [dfhack-lua-definitions](//github.com/vallode/dfhack-lua-definitions)  
  Lua language server annotations for the popular DFHack library for Dwarf Fortress
- [mhfu-blacksmith](//mhfu-blacksmith.netlify.app)  
  Database browser for the 2008 PSP game "Monster Hunter Freedom Unite", styled with the in-game UI. (Rewrite in progress)
- [stpg.tk](//stpg-tk.netlify.app)  
  Informational website for "startpage" building

Currently curious about:

- [toki pona](//tokipona.org)  
  A [constructed language](//wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) that focuses on building empathy and understanding.
- Electronics  
  Namely repairing and upgrading old things. I am fixing a radio, putting together a keyboard, and trying to upgrade the wire on my favourite headphones.
- [Functionalcs](//functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/)  
  A self-learning computer science curriculum to supplement my theoretical knowledge of programming.
