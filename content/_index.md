I'm a **web developer**, a bit of a handyperson. I am focused on UX right now, trying to supplement
my knowledge of frontend and backend programming with the empathy designers have for users.

I'm a fan of the small,
[not necessarily minimal](@/posts/2021-05-05-small-not-minimal.md), web. Feel free to explore this
plot of digital land that I call my homepage.

Here is some tech I am excited about:

- Elixir
- _Ruby on_ Rails
- Zola

different websites:
