# Hi there,

I'm **Mariusz**, also **Vallode** in many many places online.

I'm a **web developer**, a bit of a handyperson in many things tech. Focused on
learning more about User Experience. I like sci-fi, sharing, and building things
that last.

Feel free to explore this plot of digital land that I call my homepage.

I wrote a few words about my design philoshophy, 
[you can find the post here](@/posts/2021-05-05-small-not-minimal.md).

I also take care of these things:
* [stpg.tk](//stpg-tk.netlify.app)
* [FreeTube](//freetubeapp.io)
* a secret project
