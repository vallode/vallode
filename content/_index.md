I'm a **web developer**, a handyperson in many things tech. Focused on learning
more about User Experience. I like sci-fi, sharing, and building things that
last.

Thanks for dropping by, hope you find what you came for.

Working at [lobelia.earth](//lobelia.earth) helping convey climate data and
address the climate emergency.

I also help out [and-less](//and-less.at/) build a new sustainable packaging
solution.

I also take care of these things:

- [dfhack-lua-definitions](//github.com/vallode/dfhack-lua-definitions)  
  Lua language server annotations for the popular DFHack library for Dwarf
  Fortress.
- [mhfu-blacksmith](//mhfu-blacksmith.netlify.app)  
  Database browser for the 2008 PSP game "Monster Hunter Freedom Unite", styled
  with the in-game UI. (Rewrite in progress)
- [stpg.tk](//stpg-tk.netlify.app)  
  Information webpage for "startpage" building community.
- a secret project  
  More about this soon, hopefully (2023-04-11)
