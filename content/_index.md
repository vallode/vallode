Hey, welcome to the corner of the internet. I'm a web developer, I enjoy  building things that last, sharing information and knowledge, and a good debate.

I've worked with many start-ups, donning the hats of app development, devops, growth hacking, mentoring. I pride myself in the ability to pick up a task, find material to learn from, and be able to action that learning quickly and efficiently.

## Things I Enjoy

- Tinkering with things I don't understand
- Introspection and critical feedback
- Over-optimisation (mostly in video games)
- TTRPGs with friends
