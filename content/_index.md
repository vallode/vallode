I'm a **web developer**, a handyperson in many things tech. Focused on learning
more about User Experience. I like sci-fi, sharing, and building things that
last.

Thanks for dropping by, hope you find what you came for.

I am working as interim CTO at [and-less](https://and-less.at/), where I help building a
new sustainable packaging solution.

I also take care of these things:
* [mhfu-blacksmith](//mhfu-blacksmith.netlify.app)  
Database browser for the 2008 PSP game "Monster Hunter Freedom Unite", styled
with the in-game UI.
* [stpg.tk](//stpg-tk.netlify.app)  
Information webpage for "startpage" building community.
* a secret project  
More about this soon, hopefully (2022-12-23)
