# Mariusz Z.

I'm a **web developer**, a bit of a handyperson in many things tech. Focused on
learning more about User Experience. I like sci-fi, sharing, and building things
that last.

Thanks for dropping by this plot of digital land that I call my homepage.

[and-less](https://and-less.at/) currently takes most of my time, where I work
as a full-stack developer.

I also take care of these things:
* [mhfu-blacksmith](//mhfu-blacksmith.netlify.app)
* [stpg.tk](//stpg-tk.netlify.app)
* a secret project
