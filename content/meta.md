This page is dedicated to the website _itself_, for those who wish to know more about it.

## Stack

The stack is as simple as the site itself, aiming for good developer experience and leanness:

* **Zola** - For static site generation
  * Incredibly fast, single dependency binary for generating static sites. You couldn't ask for
  better, very happy with Zola coming previously from Jekyll.
* **SCSS** - For styling (built-in to Zola)
  * SCSS has long been my favourite pre-processor for CSS but it is not a hard requirement and
  probably wouldn't be a part of the stack if it were not included in Zola.
* **Netlify** - For deployment
  * Ease of use you cannot beat, I'll eventually get around to hosting this site on my own server
  but for now Netlify takes the cake.
* **Sourcehut** - For git hosting
  * No mess included git hosting, coming from gitlab it's a breath of fresh air.
