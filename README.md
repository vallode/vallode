This documentation is aimed at myself, but it might help others who want to
create a website similar to this one :)

## Development

You need [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), for deployments/hosting I use
[Netlify](https://netlify.com/).

Run locally with:

```bash
$ zola serve
```

Deploy with:

```bash
$ zola build && netlify build --prod
```
