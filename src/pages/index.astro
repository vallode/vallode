    Hey, welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm a web developer, enjoy
    building things that last, sharing information and knowledge, and a good
    debate.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've worked with many start-ups, donning the hats of app development,
    devops, growth hacking, mentoring. I pride myself in the ability to pick up
    tasks I am unfamillar with, find material to learn from, and be able to
    action that learning quickly and efficiently.
