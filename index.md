I try to aim high for anything I do, and learn from the failures along the
way. My many **hobbies** keep me busy: <span>playing the cello, cycling, writing
sci-fi, photography,</span> and trying to be a **little more**, every day, takes
up the rest of my time.

I enjoy working with **people different to me**, I have had the privilege of 
working with many exceptional characters over my <span>4 years</span> in the 
tech industry.
