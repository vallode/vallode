**Hey!** I'm Mariusz Z. (Vallode), a Web Developer placed on this small pale 
blue dot. I love **teaching**, problem solving, and communication. I currently
spend the majority of my time working at **OnHand**, helping older adults get
the help they deserve.

I try to aim high for anything I do, and learn from the failures along the
way. My many hobbies keep me busy: <span>playing the cello, cycling, writing
sci-fi, photography,</span> and trying to be a **little more**, every day, takes
up the rest of my time.

I enjoy working with **people different to me**, we can all learn so much from
each other.
