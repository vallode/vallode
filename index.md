I'm a **web developer** living on this pale blue dot. I love open communication, robust
and testable codebases, as well as teaching.

I'm currently working on a **non-profit** in it's very early stages, if you are
interested [drop me a line](mailto://mariusz+website@riseup.net)!

I can also help you out with in-depth tech consulting, and on short term
contract projects.

I aim high for anything I do, and learn from the mistakes along the way. Various
hobbies keep me busy: <span>gardening, cycling, writing
sci-fi, photography,</span> and trying to be a **little more**, every day, takes
up the rest of my time.

I enjoy working with **people different to me**, we can all learn so much from
each other.

I also manage a niche community based around building startpages on
[stpg.tk](https://stpg.tk). As well as occasionally [blog](/blog) on subjects I
find interesting.
