**Hey!** I'm Mariusz Z. (Vallode), a Web Developer placed on this small pale 
blue dot. I love **teaching**, problem solving, and communication. I am 
currently in stealth mode working on a non-profit organisation! Reach out if you
have short to medium term projects that you need help with.

I try to aim high for anything I do, and learn from the failures along the
way. My many hobbies keep me busy: <span>gardening, cycling, writing
sci-fi, photography,</span> and trying to be a **little more**, every day, takes
up the rest of my time.

I enjoy working with **people different to me**, we can all learn so much from
each other.

I also manage a niche community based around building startpages on 
[stpg.tk](https://stpg.tk). As well as occasionally [blog](/blog) on subjects I 
find interesting.
