          <p>This server is for discussing issues related to anxiety disorders such as OCD, GAD, Social Anxiety, phobias and etc. Those simply dealing with anxiety as a symptom or those who want to know more about it are also welcome. There are plenty of mods and we try to cultivate a positive and supportive environment while still accommodating the need to discuss heavier issues. A lot of effort is directed towards minimizing the kind of drama and toxicity that can eat away at online communities.</p>

            <li>a. No illegal or NSFL posts. No advocating for any violent acts or those that could be construed as harassment of an individual–if it’s the sort of thing that’s illegal everywhere it’s illegal here.
            <br/>
            b. Nothing that violates Discord’s terms of service. That means no NSFW or illegal drug talk.
            </li>
            <li>a. No spamming or flooding channels. (There’s limited exceptions.)
            <br>
            b. No advertising or promotion. (There’s an exception for established members.)
            <br>
            c. No deceptive or manipulative activities such as pretending to be different people.
            </li>
            <li>a. Do not reveal any personal info not volunteered by another member, and do not threaten to reveal that info.
            <br>
            b. Be respectful to each other. Don’t harass with excessive @pings. Do not pick fights and pursue personal vendettas. Any drama between individuals should be addressed elsewhere.
            <br>
            c. Do not use persistent derogatory language directed at individuals for the sole purpose of picking fights.
            <br>
            d. Do not propagate hateful attitudes towards attributes people cannot change. Discussion and disagreement are allowed but don’t make it nasty–make it about ideas, not people.
            </li>
            <li>No evasion of server discipline. There are various levels of discipline that fall short of kicking and banning. This allows us to be more lenient, not less, and if you undermine this system we have no other option but resorting to the more draconian measures.

          <h4>Getting Verified</h4>
          <p>
          Enter:
          <br>
          <code>!ice new</code>
          exactly in the <code>#petcetera</code> channel to get your first role. It can take awhile to grant the role, but you’ll get it.
          <br>
          Remember, it’s <code>!ice New</code>
          <br>
          This assigns yourself the New role, giving you the ability to post in the server and join the All voice channels.
          <br>
          If this doesn’t work immediately just wait for a mod to add the role. Don’t give away this command to new people.
          </p>
          <h4>The Roles</h4>
          <p>
          The <b>New</b> role is the first role. This role can embed links in <code>#sharing-blue</code> and in red zone channels.
          <br>
          Once a <b>New</b> member has behaved well for awhile, they’ll be upgraded to to the <b>Blue</b> role which grants them access to <b>Blue</b>-only text and voice channels.
          <br>
          If a <b>Blue</b> member makes it to level 15, and gets approved, they’ll be granted the <b>Veteran</b> role which grants access to more hidden channels.
          <br>
          In addition to the primary roles, there are smaller roles with specialized purposes:
          <ul style='list-style-type:disc; margin-left:50px'>
              <li><b>Talker</b> role is given to those with an interest in using the voice channels. It gets @role pinged when a voice chat is ongoing.</li>
              <li><b>Zone</b> role grants access to the <code>#zone-danger</code> channel where really controversial subjects are discussed.</li>
          </ul>
