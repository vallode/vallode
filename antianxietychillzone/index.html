          <p>This server is for discussing issues related to anxiety disorders such as OCD, GAD, Social Anxiety, phobias and etc. Those simply dealing with anxiety as a symptom or those who want to know more about it are also welcome. There are plenty of mods and we try to cultivate a positive and supportive environment while still accommodating the need to discuss heavier issues. A lot of effort is directed towards minimizing the kind of drama and toxicity that can eat away at online communities.</p>

            <li>No evasion of server discipline. There are various levels of discipline that fall short of kicking and banning. This allows us to be more lenient, not less, and if you undermine this system we have no other option but resorting to the more draconian measures.

          exactly in the <code>#petcetera</code> channel to get your first role. It can take awhile to grant the role, but you’ll get it.
          <br>
          Remember, it’s <code>!ice New</code>
          <br>
          This assigns yourself the New role, giving you the ability to post in the server and join the All voice channels.
          <br>
          If this doesn’t work immediately just wait for a mod to add the role. Don’t give away this command to new people.

          <h4 id='theroles'>The Roles</h4>
          <p>
          The <b>New</b> role is the first role. This role can embed links in <code>#sharing-blue</code> and in red zone channels.
          <br>
          Once a <b>New</b> member has behaved well for awhile, they’ll be upgraded to to the <b>Blue</b> role which grants them access to <b>Blue</b>-only text and voice channels.
          <br>
          If a <b>Blue</b> member makes it to level 15, and gets approved, they’ll be granted the <b>Veteran</b> role which grants access to more hidden channels.
          <br>
          In addition to the primary roles, there are smaller roles with specialized purposes:
          <ul style='list-style-type:disc; margin-left:50px'>
              <li><b>Talker</b> role is given to those with an interest in using the voice channels. It gets @role pinged when a voice chat is ongoing.</li>

              <h4>Server Advice</h4>
              <br>
              <h5 id='noteaboutblocking'>A note about blocking</h5>
              <p>If you’re blocked by someone or suspect it, do not ask in the main server. This policy follows from rule <b>3.b</b>.
              <br>
              When someone is accused of blocking publicly it creates a situation where the fairness of the block is called into question, and then there are two people who have to defend their reputations, and then the entire server is thrown off-topic to argue an unrelated personal dispute. This server is for those hoping to avoid such drama. Do not PM multiple mods or other users in an attempt to get them to bother whoever blocked you. Such action violates <b>rule 3.b</b> as well.</p>
              <h5>How to talk to us</h5>
              <p>If you need to talk to the owner or a mod, ask us in the server and we’ll initiate the conversation. <b>Do not PM us</b>. Ask the mods to add you to a hidden channel and you can talk there.</p>
              <h5>Be careful with selfies and other camera uploads</h5>
              <p>It’s very easy to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_image_search' target='_blank'>reverse image search</a> an image to link back to someone’s online profile and leak information you want private. There’s personal info in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata#Photographs' target='_blank'>metadata</a> of photos. We strongly advise that users share selfies over direct messages. This isn’t a hard rule but it’s something that is strongly advised.</p>
              <h5>Direct Messages</h5>
              <p>It’s been standard practice here for mods to DM people only when necessary and to deal with support in server. This is a bigger server, and anyone can to get overloaded by DM support requests. Please do not send people DMs unless it’s necessary.
              <br>
              Working together in the server itself allows people to share the burden. If you want to talk with just mods or anyone else, that can be done on a hidden channel.
              <br>
              Because of this, in the future we’d like to see all high profile members treated the same as staff in regards to DMs.
              <br>
              <a href='https://discordapp.com/invite/dxxPx' target='_blank'>Use our DiscordMe link</a> instead of invites :).</p>
              <h4 id='safetywarnings'>Safety Warnings</h4>
              <p>Do not open any <b>.exe</b> files or <b>links</b> sent to you in PM from random users. There’s nasty people out there who send viruses and trojans this way.
              <br>
              If you are being spammed by PMs, it’s a good idea to change your server privacy settings to block them:</p>
               <ol>
                <li>Open the server menu</li>
                <li>Select Privacy Settings</li>
